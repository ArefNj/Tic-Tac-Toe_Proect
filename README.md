# Tic-Tac-Toe Proect

Advanced Programming Project #1

The first project is a simulation of the Tic-Tac-Toe game in a console
application *(non-graphics)*. This game is very popular and is fairly simple

There are a few differences with the classical one:


• The board is square with 16 cells (4*4)

• Some cells will be randomly locked *(no player can use these cells)*

• The goal of Tic-Tac-Toe is to be one of the players to get three same
  symbols in a row *(horizontally, vertically, or diagonally)*
  
• Up to 2 players can play simultaneously. 

*(For single player, the other player can be an AI)*

There are two options for players:

o Human

o Computer

*For the option human, both the players are human and for the option
computer, the first player is human and the second player is computer*


Player 1 as '  X  ' and player 2 as ' O ' enter their moves in each step.

• there are only three possible results:


o a player wins

o his opponent *(human or computer)* wins

o it’s a tie! *(For equal or impossible score)*
